# Cleanup Report

## Files Removed
The following files were removed as they are no longer needed after the refactoring:

1. **fix-edge-functions.ps1** - Original script for fixing edge functions issues
2. **fix-edge-functions-v2.ps1** - Second version of the fix script
3. **fix-edge-functions-v3.ps1** - Third version of the fix script
4. **fix-functions.ps1** - Alternative fix script
5. **restart-services.ps1** - Service restart script

## Reason for Removal
These scripts were created as temporary solutions to fix issues with the Supabase Edge Functions. After our comprehensive refactoring:

1. We've temporarily disabled the problematic Edge Functions service in the docker-compose.yml
2. We've implemented proper automated setup scripts (setup-automated.sh and setup-automated.ps1)
3. The docker-compose.yml now has improved health checks and proper dependency management

## Retained Files
We've kept the following essential files:

1. **setup-automated.sh** - Linux/macOS setup script
2. **setup-automated.ps1** - Windows setup script
3. **docker-compose.yml** - Main configuration file with security enhancements
4. **.env** - Environment configuration file (should be customized for production)

## Documentation Updates
We've replaced the old README.md with a comprehensive new version that includes:

1. Detailed security information
2. Cross-platform setup instructions
3. Improved troubleshooting section
4. Clear deployment guidelines
5. Security best practices

## Next Steps
1. Test the automated installation on a fresh system
2. Consider implementing a backup strategy
3. Add an HTTPS reverse proxy for production deployments
4. Implement monitoring for the services

This cleanup has significantly reduced complexity while improving security and maintainability of the AI Chat Agent stack.
